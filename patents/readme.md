# Patents

I am an inventor: I have two patents for wireless communication applications.

## Dominance

**[Dominance](https://github.com/ej838639/code/tree/main/patents/dominance "Dominance patent folder")**: Patent 10245442: "Dominance-Based Coverage Management for Wireless Communication Network"

**Summary**: Algorithm that ingests geo-located mobile device measurement reports to automatically downtilt or uptilt cellular bast station antennas to improve coverage and reduce interference.

## Automatic RET Label

**[RET Label](https://github.com/ej838639/code/tree/main/patents/auto_ret_label "RET Label patent folder")**: Patent 11296936: "Automatic Antenna Association For Cellular Telecommunication Network (RET Audit)"

**Summary**: Algorithm to methodically and autonomously align the Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) Label of antennas to the proper network cell name. This enables large-scale automatic antenna tilt changes to improve coverage and reduce interference.

Automatically adjust antenna tilts, evaluate the change in distribution of user traffic using Timing Advance counters, determine the correlation between RET and cell name, and then automatically update the RET Label for the antennas. Adjust the antenna tilts during the night (aka the Maintenance Window) when very few people are using the cell site to minimize the number of customers impacted by the temporary network coverage loss.
